# Data Analyst Job Market Analysis (September 2024)
Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the Data Analyst job vacancies in September 2024 by web scraping data from **Indeed** using an open-source parser. The dataset is processed, cleaned, and transformed using **Python**, with further manual review and cleaning in **Excel**. A **Power BI** dashboard was created to visualize key insights, answering the following questions:

What is the average salary for Data Analysts?
What are the most required technical and soft skills?
How does salary depend on experience and location?
Which industries employ the most Data Analysts?
Which employers have the highest number of vacancies?
Tools Used
Web Scraping: An open-source parser to extract job data from Indeed.
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Python (pandas, numpy, etc.) for data wrangling.
Data Proofing: Manual review and minor adjustments in Excel.
Data Visualization: Power BI dashboard based on Excel data.

1. Data Scraping
I used an open-source parser to scrape Data Analyst job listings from Indeed for September 2024. The scraped data included information such as job titles, salaries, locations, required skills, and experience levels.

2. Data Cleaning & Transformation
